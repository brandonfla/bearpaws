# Conversation Export — Bearpaws Phase 1 Implementation Kickoff

**Exported:** 2026-05-01
**Original chat summary:** QA audit of bearpaws (a token-efficiency-focused fork of superpowers v5.0.7), followed by Phase 0 cleanup execution (6 commits) and Phase 1 implementation plan authoring (1 commit). The next session picks up by executing the Phase 1 plan task-by-task.

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Bearpaws** is a Claude Code (and Gemini CLI) skills plugin — a hard fork of [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) v5.0.7 by Jesse Vincent and contributors. The fork's primary differentiator is **token-efficiency**: same behavioral pass rates as superpowers but significantly reduced per-session token consumption through structured compression, deferred loading, and tighter prompt engineering.

The plugin's job: inject the `using-bearpaws` bootstrap at session start so the agent learns to discover and invoke the rest of the skills via the `Skill` tool. Skills cover TDD, debugging, planning, code review, parallel execution, plus (in Phase 2) domain-knowledge for Google Cloud, Google ADK, Vite, JS/TypeScript, and Cloud Run.

**Working directory:** `/Users/brandon/Downloads/bearpaws/`
**Owner:** Brandon Fitzgerald (fitzgerald.brandoni@gmail.com)
**Repo:** https://gitlab.com/fitzgerald.brandoni/bearpaws
**Phasing:** 4-phase program (0–3) per [docs/bearpaws/specs/2026-04-30-bearpaws-fork-design.md](../specs/2026-04-30-bearpaws-fork-design.md). Phase 0 = identity-only fork. Phase 1 = vertical slice (XML schema + first migrations). Phase 2 = parallel rollout. Phase 3 = ship 1.0.

## 2. Current State

**Where things stand:** Phase 0 baseline tagged at `v0.1.0`; Phase 0 cleanup (the work needed to actually finish Phase 0 — release notes claimed dropped platforms but files remained) just landed in 6 commits on top of the tag. Phase 1 implementation plan is written and committed; **no Phase 1 implementation work has started yet**.

- **What's working:**
  - Bootstrap hook produces valid JSON with `<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>` wrapper (Phase 1 Task 4 changes that to `<warning level="hard">`).
  - Versions in sync at `0.1.0` across all 4 declared manifests.
  - Skill-triggering test runner is healthy (portable timeout, env handling, namespaced skill prefix matching).
  - `tests/skill-triggering/run-all.sh` passed 5/6 at v0.1.0 baseline (writing-plans was the 1 known-flaky; documented as a defensible matcher choice, not a bug).
  - Bootstrap rebrand is clean: 0 stale `superpowers` / `Copilot` / `docs/superpowers` refs (only intentional attribution remains).
  - Baseline metrics locked in [docs/bearpaws/release-notes/0.1.0.md](../release-notes/0.1.0.md).

- **What's in progress:**
  - **Phase 1 plan ready to execute.** 12 tasks. First action is Task 0 — re-run `tests/skill-triggering/run-all.sh` to lock the post-cleanup baseline before any behavioral changes.

- **What's broken / blocked:**
  - `scripts/bump-version.sh --audit` has a preexisting bug: path-prefix excludes (`docs/bearpaws/specs`, etc.) don't filter under BSD grep (basename-only). Audit still flags those files. Documented in commit [c7651f3](#) as "queued for later." NOT a blocker for Phase 1.
  - `tests/skill-triggering/run-all.sh` was NOT actually re-run after the post-tag Phase 0 cleanup. The 5/6 baseline is from the v0.1.0 tag; whether the path rebrands changed that is unverified. **Phase 1 Task 0 closes this gap.**

## 3. Key Decisions & Rationale

1. **Phase 0 cleanup landed as commits on top of the v0.1.0 tag, not a re-tag.** — Tagging was already done; the cleanup is documented in the v0.1.0 release notes' "Phase 0 cleanup follow-up (post-baseline)" section. Re-tagging would imply a different ship; the actual semantic is "we shipped, then realized cleanup wasn't fully done, then finished it transparently."

2. **README "delivering...significantly reducing" framing kept but flagged.** — This claim is forward-looking; v0.1.0 is byte-for-byte upstream. I noted to the user that strict honesty would say "aims to deliver" until measurements exist, but the user kept the present-tense framing. **Phase 1 makes this claim provable** by producing the first measurements. If Phase 1 lands and the bootstrap shrink hits ≥40%, the claim becomes honest.

3. **Bootstrap migration is isolated from any other content change in Phase 1.** — The bootstrap is read by every session. A regression there regresses everything. Phase 1 plan Task 5 migrates the bootstrap alone; only after it passes pressure-prompt eval does Task 6 (TDD migration) begin.

4. **`<include>` semantics validated by transcript inspection in Task 6, not Task 5.** — Bootstrap can't use `<include>` (circular: agent hasn't been taught the convention yet). TDD is the first chance to confirm `<include>` actually causes the agent to `Read` the included file when the skill is invoked. If it doesn't, dedup wins evaporate; the plan documents the demote-back-inline path.

5. **Token-measurement script is a deliverable, not an afterthought.** — Phase 1 exit criterion E4 requires "bootstrap shrink ≥40%". Without a deterministic byte counter, the claim has no proof. Task 1 builds the script; every Phase 1+ measurement runs through it.

6. **`assets/superpowers-small.svg` deleted, not renamed.** — Confirmed via grep that nothing references it; only `app-icon.png` is wired up. Renaming would have been preserved-but-dead weight.

7. **`.github/FUNDING.yml` deleted, not retargeted.** — Pointed Sponsors at upstream maintainer `obra`. No bearpaws sponsor account exists, so removal was correct. If/when one exists, re-add.

8. **No Co-Authored-By trailers in commits.** — Memorized user preference (per project CLAUDE.md and `~/.claude/projects/-Users-brandon-Downloads-bearpaws/memory/feedback_no_claude_in_commits.md`). All 7 commits in this session are clean.

9. **Phase 0 cleanup did NOT delete `docs/plans/` or `docs/superpowers/` (upstream historical docs).** — The user's last response on this topic was "complete phase 0" without explicit decision on issue #6 from the QA report. Those directories are untouched; if they should be archived/deleted, that's a separate decision (open question carried into Phase 1).

## 4. Technical Context

### Architecture / Stack

- **Language:** bash for hooks/scripts/tests; Node.js for the brainstorm server; Python 3 for `tests/claude-code/analyze-token-usage.py` and JSON parsing in helpers.
- **Skill loader:** Claude Code's `Skill` tool (primary); Gemini CLI's `activate_skill` (secondary, supported via `gemini-extension.json`).
- **Bootstrap mechanism:** `SessionStart` hook → `hooks/run-hook.cmd` (polyglot bash/cmd) → `hooks/session-start` (extensionless on purpose; Windows auto-detection prepends `bash` to `.sh` files which would double-wrap) → reads `skills/using-bearpaws/SKILL.md` → emits JSON with `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` (Claude Code) or `additionalContext` top-level (Copilot/SDK) or `additional_context` (Cursor — but Cursor was dropped in Phase 0 cleanup; that branch is dead code now).

### Environment & Configuration

- **Plugin registration for testing:** `~/.claude/settings.json` should have `"plugins": { "bearpaws@bearpaws-dev": true }, "marketplaces": { "bearpaws-dev": "/Users/brandon/Downloads/bearpaws" }`. Or pass `claude --plugin-dir /Users/brandon/Downloads/bearpaws`.
- **Test invocation:** `tests/skill-triggering/run-test.sh` does `env -u CLAUDECODE` so the suite can run inside an active Claude Code session without nested-session refusal. Logs land at `/tmp/bearpaws-tests/<timestamp>/`.
- **No env-var secrets needed.** Tests use the user's `claude` CLI auth.

## 5. Code & Implementation

No new code authored in this session beyond what landed in commits. The Phase 1 plan defines the work but does not pre-author any of it. The session's deliverables are:

- **6 commits implementing Phase 0 finishing cleanup** (see Section 6 git log).
- **1 commit adding the Phase 1 implementation plan** (`docs/bearpaws/plans/2026-05-01-bearpaws-phase-1-vertical-slice.md`, 1412 lines, 12 tasks).
- **This handoff file** (saved to `docs/bearpaws/handoffs/`; not yet committed at time of writing — user can decide).

### Significant content changes (recap of the 6 cleanup commits)

1. **[52f0cd4] chore: drop Cursor/Codex/Copilot platform vestiges** — deleted `hooks/hooks-cursor.json`, `scripts/sync-to-codex-plugin.sh`, `tests/codex-plugin-sync/`, `tests/opencode/` (5 files), and removed the "In Copilot CLI:" paragraph from `skills/using-bearpaws/SKILL.md`. -1650 lines.

2. **[d27c131] chore: rebrand skill body paths** — across writing-plans, brainstorming, requesting-code-review, subagent-driven-development, using-git-worktrees, spec-document-reviewer-prompt, brainstorm scripts, frame-template.html. Rewrote: `docs/superpowers/{plans,specs}` → `docs/bearpaws/{plans,specs}`; `~/.config/superpowers/{worktrees,hooks}` → `~/.config/bearpaws/*`; `.superpowers/brainstorm` → `.bearpaws/brainstorm`. Page title in `frame-template.html`: "Superpowers Brainstorming" → "Bearpaws Brainstorming".

3. **[90f0a87] chore: rebrand test fixtures and docs/testing.md** — fixtures in `tests/claude-code/` and `tests/explicit-skill-requests/` (scripts + 6 prompt files) plus `tests/subagent-driven-dev/go-fractals/plan.md` (`github.com/superpowers-test/` → `github.com/bearpaws-test/`). `docs/testing.md` "Run from superpowers directory" instructions retargeted.

4. **[c7651f3] chore: drop unused branding asset, stale FUNDING, extend audit excludes** — `assets/superpowers-small.svg` (zero refs), `.github/FUNDING.yml` (pointed at upstream), and added `docs/bearpaws/release-notes` + `README.md` to `.version-bump.json#audit.exclude`.

5. **[053d165] docs: sharpen token-efficiency framing in README and CLAUDE.md** — README now opens with the token-efficiency thesis. CLAUDE.md re-ordered so fork goal precedes the surface-level skill catalog.

6. **[6492a89] docs: snapshot v0.1.0 baseline metrics + Phase 0 cleanup log** — added a "Baseline metrics" section to release notes with bootstrap bytes (5,292), aggregate SKILL.md bytes (108,393), per-skill table, and full skills/ payload (260,981). Also documented the Phase 0 cleanup sweep itself.

7. **[e8f6849] docs: scope Phase 1 implementation plan** — `docs/bearpaws/plans/2026-05-01-bearpaws-phase-1-vertical-slice.md`, 1412 lines.

## 6. Problems Solved

1. **Phase 0 release notes claimed Cursor/Codex/Copilot were dropped, but the files were still in the tree** → Deleted them in commit [52f0cd4]. Identified during initial QA audit (the user's first ask).

2. **Skills told users to write plans/specs to `docs/superpowers/...`, but project convention is `docs/bearpaws/...`** → Rebranded across all skill bodies + matching test fixtures in [d27c131] + [90f0a87]. The skills and test fixtures had to move together — fixing only one would have broken the test suite.

3. **`bump-version.sh --audit` flagged drift in files that were "in" the exclude list** → Discovered the BSD-grep `--exclude-dir` is basename-only, so path-prefix patterns (`docs/bearpaws/specs`) never matched. Documented in commit [c7651f3]; the entries express intent for when the script gets fixed. Out of scope for Phase 0 finish.

4. **README "delivering same performance, fewer tokens" claim was misleading at v0.1.0** (v0.1.0 is byte-for-byte upstream; no compression yet) → User chose to keep the framing. Plan acknowledges that Phase 1 makes this claim provable; the v0.1.0 release notes are explicit about what shipped vs. what's projected.

5. **No anchor for Phase 1's "30% smaller" claims** → Snapshotted four byte counts in the release notes ([6492a89]): bootstrap, SKILL.md aggregate, per-skill, full payload. Phase 1 measurements diff against these.

6. **Phase 1 plan initially had `(rows moved from...)` placeholder text** → Self-review caught this; replaced with the concrete 8-keep / 4-move row split in the plan, with rationale (task-shape rationalizations stay; meta-cognitive rationalizations move).

## 7. Open Issues & Known Limitations

1. **Skill-triggering tests not re-run post-cleanup.** The 5/6 baseline in the release notes is from the v0.1.0 tag, before the Phase 0 cleanup commits. Phase 1 plan Task 0 closes this gap. Until Task 0 runs, the actual current pass rate is technically unverified.

2. **`bump-version.sh --audit` path-prefix excludes don't work.** Preexisting issue; my edits to `.version-bump.json` add entries that document intent but don't actually filter. Fix queued for later.

3. **`docs/plans/` and `docs/superpowers/` directories preserve upstream historical content.** Not Phase-0-related per se, but they bloat clone size. Decision deferred — was issue #6 in the QA report; user did not include it in "complete phase 0".

4. **API-driven test suites (`tests/claude-code/run-skill-tests.sh`, etc.) not run.** Skipped to avoid burning API tokens during cleanup. Phase 1 plan delegates re-baseline to Task 0 explicitly.

5. **Bootstrap pressure-prompt set is documented in the plan but not yet captured.** The plan defines 5 prompts; Phase 1 Task 5.1 captures the actual baseline responses by running them in a fresh session. No baseline transcripts exist yet.

6. **No Phase 1 worktree created.** The writing-plans skill's default suggests a brainstorm-style worktree for new work; this is a multi-task phase, not a single-feature add, so a worktree was deemed unnecessary. Next session can create one if preferred (`tests/using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md` post-rebrand says `~/.config/bearpaws/worktrees/`).

## 8. Next Steps

The Phase 1 plan is the authoritative task list. Execute in order:

1. [ ] **Task 0** — Run `tests/skill-triggering/run-all.sh` against `main` (post-cleanup) and lock the result. Update the plan's baseline table with the actual pass rate. (Plan §"Pre-flight")
2. [ ] **Task 1** — Build `tests/token-measurement/measure.sh`. Smoke-test against current state (should match the 5,292 / 108,393 numbers from the release notes). (Plan §"Track A: Foundations")
3. [ ] **Task 2** — Append `## XML schema` section to `skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` (canonical reference for the tag whitelist).
4. [ ] **Task 3** — Build `tests/schema-validator/run-validator.sh` (greps `skills/` for tags outside the whitelist). Currently FAILS on legacy tags; that's the migration backlog.
5. [ ] **Task 4** — Switch `hooks/session-start` wrapper from `<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>` to `<warning level="hard">`. Pressure-test with 3 prompts in a fresh session before committing.
6. [ ] **Task 5** — Migrate `skills/using-bearpaws/SKILL.md` to XML schema. Bootstrap-only; isolated. Run pressure-prompt set against pre- and post-migration; behavioral parity required. Target ≥40% bootstrap shrink (5,292 → ≤3,175 bytes).
7. [ ] **Task 6** — Migrate `skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md`. First chance to validate `<include>` semantics by checking if the agent actually `Read`s `_shared/red-flags-skill-discipline.md` when the TDD skill is invoked.
8. [ ] **Tasks 7–9** — Write the Cloud Run pair (`cloud-run` + `deploying-to-cloud-run`) and add their skill-triggering tests.
9. [ ] **Tasks 10–12** — Confirm 4 exit criteria pass; write `docs/bearpaws/release-notes/0.2.0.md`; bump to `0.2.0`; tag.

**Ship gate:** Phase 1 ships only when all 4 exit criteria (E1–E4) pass. If any single one fails, do NOT advance to Phase 2.

**Suggested working mode:** subagent-driven for Tasks 5 and 6 (bootstrap and TDD migrations — high blast radius; fresh subagent per task gives clean eval signal). Either mode for everything else.

## 9. User Preferences & Working Style

- **Commit conventions:** No `Co-Authored-By:` lines or any AI/LLM attribution. Clean trailers only. Documented in [CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md) and persisted in user memory (`~/.claude/projects/-Users-brandon-Downloads-bearpaws/memory/feedback_no_claude_in_commits.md`).
- **Documentation location:** Project docs live under `docs/bearpaws/`. The previous-session habit of putting plans at `docs/superpowers/plans/` (inherited from upstream) is wrong; everything bearpaws-specific goes under `docs/bearpaws/`.
- **Commit style:** Multi-paragraph imperative-mood commit messages with explicit "why this commit, why this scope". Look at recent git log for examples (e.g. `90f0a87`, `e8f6849`) — verbose body, focused subject.
- **Communication style:** Direct, terse, evidence-first. The user pushed back when I framed a recommendation as flattering ("do I think it'll hold up?") and got the most useful response when I gave honest reservations alongside concrete actions. Honest assessments beat reassurance.
- **Decision style:** User makes the calls. When I flagged "the README claim is misleading at v0.1.0" they kept the framing — they're aware of the gap and accept the risk. Don't over-correct on their behalf.
- **No PRs requested.** Direct commits to main. Tags are the ship boundaries.
- **Eval discipline:** Skills are "behavior-shaping code, not prose." Changes to Red Flags tables, rationalization lists, and "your human partner" phrasing require eval evidence per the writing-skills TDD-on-prose loop. Don't make these changes for "reads cleaner" reasons.

### Working tree status

Clean. The handoff file (this one) is the only untracked file at the time of writing — user can decide whether to commit it.

### Bootstrap byte count (current state)

```
$ CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=$(pwd) bash hooks/session-start | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(len(json.load(sys.stdin)['hookSpecificOutput']['additionalContext']))"
5292
```

### Skill-triggering test runner invocation pattern

```bash
# Single skill:
tests/skill-triggering/run-test.sh systematic-debugging tests/skill-triggering/prompts/systematic-debugging.txt

# Full suite:
tests/skill-triggering/run-all.sh
```

The runner uses `env -u CLAUDECODE` to escape the parent Claude Code session and `--plugin-dir "$PLUGIN_DIR"` to register THIS checkout as the active plugin. Logs land at `/tmp/bearpaws-tests/<timestamp>/`. Pass detection: looks for `"name":"Skill"` plus `"skill":"<name>"` (with optional namespace prefix) in stream-json output.

### Frontmatter convention (for Phase 1 new skills)

```yaml
---
name: skill-name-with-hyphens
description: Use when [specific triggering conditions and symptoms]
---
```

- `description` is third-person, describes WHEN to use (not what it does).
- Frontmatter total ≤ 1024 chars.
- `name` is letters/numbers/hyphens only.

### Spec exit criteria (Phase 1)

E1: Bootstrap eval ≥ baseline (pressure scenarios pass).
E2: TDD eval ≥ baseline (pressure scenarios pass).
E3: Cloud Run pair triggers on naive prompts.
E4: Bootstrap shrink ≥ 40% (target 50%; accept 40% as pass).

All four required for Phase 1 ship at `0.2.0`.

### Auto-memory state at handoff

The user has one entry in `~/.claude/projects/-Users-brandon-Downloads-bearpaws/memory/`:

- `feedback_no_claude_in_commits.md` — never include Co-Authored-By or AI attribution in commit messages.

No project memory yet about the Phase 1 work itself. Next session may want to add a project memory like "Phase 1 in progress: vertical slice (bootstrap + TDD + Cloud Run pair); plan at docs/bearpaws/plans/2026-05-01-...; first action is Task 0 baseline lock" if the work spans multiple sessions.
